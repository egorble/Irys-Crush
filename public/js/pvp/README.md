# PVP Game System - Modular Architecture

This directory contains the modular PVP game system, broken down into focused, maintainable components.

## Architecture Overview

The PVP game system has been refactored from a single large file into multiple specialized modules:

### Core Modules

1. **pvp-game-styles.js** - CSS styles and styling management
   - Game interface styles
   - Animation styles  
   - Results display styles
   - Dynamic style injection and cleanup

2. **pvp-game-logic.js** - Match-3 game mechanics
   - Board generation and management
   - Match finding and processing
   - Cell interactions and animations
   - Bomb mechanics
   - Score calculation

3. **pvp-game-ui.js** - User interface management
   - Game interface display
   - Timer and score updates
   - Game over screens
   - Forfeit functionality
   - Results display

4. **pvp-game-results.js** - Result submission and monitoring
   - Blockchain result submission
   - Game completion monitoring
   - Leaderboard management
   - Winner determination

5. **pvp-game.js** - Main game engine (reduced)
   - Core game state management
   - Timer management
   - Module coordination
   - Game lifecycle

6. **pvp-game-launcher.js** - Global functions
   - Game startup functions
   - Module dependency checking
   - Error handling

7. **pvp-game-loader.js** - Module loading system
   - Dynamic module loading
   - Dependency management
   - Load order enforcement
   - Error recovery

## Loading System

The new system uses a smart loader that:

- Loads modules in the correct dependency order
- Handles loading errors gracefully
- Verifies module availability before use
- Provides loading status feedback
- Prevents duplicate loading

## Usage

The system is automatically loaded when `pvp-game-loader.js` is included:

```html
<script src="js/pvp/pvp-game-loader.js"></script>
```

The loader will:
1. Load all required modules in sequence
2. Verify dependencies
3. Dispatch a `pvpGameSystemReady` event when complete

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Cleaner code organization

### Performance
- Modules can be loaded on-demand
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Better caching strategies

### Scalability
- Easy to add new features
- Modular testing possible
- Independent module updates

### Developer Experience
- Clearer code structure
- Easier debugging
- Better separation of concerns

## Module Dependencies

```
pvp-game-styles.js (no dependencies)
    ↓
pvp-game-logic.js (depends on styles)
    ↓
pvp-game-ui.js (depends on styles)
    ↓
pvp-game-results.js (no additional dependencies)
    ↓
pvp-game.js (depends on all above)
    ↓
pvp-game-launcher.js (depends on all above)
```

## Events

The system dispatches these events:

- `pvpGameSystemReady` - All modules loaded successfully
- Custom game events through the main engine

## Error Handling

The loader includes comprehensive error handling:
- Module loading failures
- Dependency verification
- Runtime error recovery
- Graceful degradation

## Migration Notes

The refactored system maintains full backward compatibility with the existing PVP system while providing a much cleaner internal architecture.
